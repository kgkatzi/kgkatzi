## üõ†Ô∏è My Projects
- [**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/OCR): Developed an image-to-text model using Matlab and k-NN, achieving 95%+ accuracy.
- [**Image Registration**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/Image-Registration): Integrated feature detection for satellite image alignment using Matlab.
- [**Robotics Kinematic Control**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/Robotics): Engineered a 6-DOF robotic arm controller using Matlab's Robotics Toolbox for dynamic tracking.
- [**Neural Network Development**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/mlp_from_scratch): Built MLP, SVM, and RBF neural networks from scratch in Python.
- [**Black Box Parameter Estimation**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/black-box): Analyzed unknown systems using MATLAB for minimum error. Implemented proof of linearity, parameter estimation (offline and online), and performance evaluation.
- [**DNG2RGB**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/DNG2RGB): Created a MATLAB project to convert raw images in DNG format to RGB using functions for white balance, interpolation, and color space conversion.
- [**Genetic Algorithm Optimization**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/genetic): Implemented a MATLAB-based Genetic Algorithm for solving optimization problems through selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.



## ü§ù Team Projects
- [**KitchenGuard-Arduino-Project**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/KitchenGuard-Arduino-Project): Designed a sensor network using Arduino to prevent kitchen accidents. Worked on developing real-time hazard detection for gas leaks, water boiling, fires, and water leaks, integrating wireless communication, LCD alerts, and buzzer notifications.
- [**UART Communication System**](https://github.com/kgkatzi/Uart): Developed a complete UART system in Verilog, including transmitter, receiver, and supporting modules for baud rate control, error detection, and LED display.
- [**Data for Murders Website**](https://github.com/Nantina/database-web-app): Developed a full-stack web app using Python (Flask) for the backend and Angular for the frontend, providing CRUD functionalities for managing murder-related data.
